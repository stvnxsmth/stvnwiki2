During periods of upheaval our visions of the future become clouded by the static of uncertainty. As individuals we lose the ability to plan our daily lives; as societies we become singularly transfixed by the present danger. The fog of war is another way of describing this feeling: a debilitating lack of situational awareness that usually presages hasty decision-making. However, it is this language of war that amplifies our sense of precariousness yet rarely serves to alleviate it — and history bears many examples.

## The Zeitgeist Shifts

Moments shared in time by whole societies are few and far between. Opinion may differ, but to my mind 9/11 was that last such event. The zeitgeist shifted that day as the language of war proliferated across new media, especially conservative talk radio.

Soon after and with a 90% approval rating¹, George W. Bush signed the U.S.A PATRIOT Act. That act set in motion a decades long assault on privacy, oversight, and accountability by the intelligence services. The failed wars on Iraq, Afghanistan, and the nebulous “terror” were used to justify torture, extrajudicial murder, and illegal mass data collection programs exposed by Edward Snowden in 2013.

The legal vacuum that enabled those programs also granted cover to the fledgling technology industry to develop systems the intelligence services would soon covet. Those innovations now undergird the information economy with human attention as its currency. As a result, the extraction and analysis of data for commercial interests through digital surveillance has been normalised and its expansion is accelerating with the coronavirus pandemic.

## Pandemic is War?

As would any populist demagogue, Donald Trump has used the coronavirus pandemic to label himself a “war-time president”. Angela Merkel, Boris Johnson, and Governor Cuomo have also deployed the trope in recent weeks—finally, bipartisan unity! Only we know our enemy is neither living nor dead, cannot be seen nor bombed, and frankly couldn’t care less about privacy. What purpose does militaristic rhetoric serve, then?

The obvious explanation is a projection of authority. An attempt to corral support by preying upon our evolutionary instincts to follow the leader when threatened. More cynically, “war time” politicians have a higher likelihood of reelection; and their actions more readily justified however miscalculated. As I have described, policy decisions taken in the face of a threat can be incredibly sticky and without adequate oversight, can prevail for longer than the initial threat.

A question to ask then is: which errors will be the 2020 equivalent to the PATRIOT Act and perpetual war in the Middle East?

Given the magnitude of risk posed by the pandemic there could be many answers. In the past several years there has been  [mounting criticism of big tech companies](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21152774/big-tech-regulation-antitrust-ftc-facebook-google-amazon-apple-youtube?)  Cambridge Analytica, misinformation, censorship, and privacy. But as their tools become critical to suppression and relief efforts, the pandemic provides cover and plausible deniability for further possible issues.

It must be said that the pandemic also grants an opportunity at redemption for big tech. This pandemic may equally prove to be the moment of true maturation into a pillar of civilisation for the tech industry. Coupled with the moral imperative to use all available tools to save lives this means we will forge ahead—risks, consequences, and benefits abound. What must be guarded against is complacency.

## Surveillance Proliferates

There have been global failures of governance in recent weeks—testing, PPE, late lockdowns—in “war time” they’re inevitable. No organisation, public or private, is immune. The question is from where might such errors occur?

Various applications of technology across the world are in use to trace, track, and isolate cases of infection. In Taiwan quarantine orders are enforced by geofencing homes of the infected with authorities alerted to breaches; in Singapore, an app using background Bluetooth to trace close contacts of infected people; and in Israel, location tracking used to automatically issue quarantine orders — approved without legislative consultation.

In the U.S., too, “aggregated and anonymised” location data supplied by  [Google](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) , Facebook, network carriers, and the advertising industry are being used to assess lockdown compliance and inform logistics.

By way of example, an [Italian startup using artificial intelligence](https://blog.logograb.com/covid19-visual-ai-analysis-lockdown-violation-italy)  *“harvested images and video from 552,000 profiles and their public Instagram stories (totalling 504,592 stories”* to monitor quarantine compliance. This is powerful technology executed without express consent of Instagram users. To the team’s credit all data was anonymised, though it can’t be taken as certain all such startups would do the same. What protections are there against authoritarian exploitation of similar technologies?

This [data visualisation](https://twitter.com/TectonixGEO/status/1243006977594273792)  tracking anonymised phone data in New York shows both how much data can be gleaned from a single device and the sprawl of human movement. But how anonymous is anonymised data anyway? Not very. Big data analytics companies such as Palantir can take several large datasets and find commonality between them that can build a picture of the data’s creator. Facial recognition software, too, is quickly becoming ubiquitous and when coupled with the other examples cited here, portends a future in which everyone is eminently identifiable.

Do we believe that data gathered during this time will not be used to accelerate the development of data analysis and “personalisation” tools? Will legislation make encroachment in our daily lives to defeat this pandemic permanent? Will users be consulted on these practices or, at a minimum, informed of their use? Do people have a rightful stake in their data and its inherent value? Will our next steps be permanent or temporary?

## Why Should We Care?

The answers will come eventually and once again we will be in a state of reactivity, not proactivity. The reason we should care is that the dangers lie not only with our civil liberties, but also the existing fissures in society that remain unresolved.

The combination of uncertainty, collective threat, and sweeping surveillance measures is ripe for authoritarian opportunism. Societal institutions across the world were already brittle pre-pandemic and the pressures on migration, trade, cultural values, and inequality may well shatter them.

To regain our ability to visualise the future we must earn it. Our societies are changing and—as corporate power is centralised and authoritarianism consolidates—we risk living in a future less our own than what we imagine.
