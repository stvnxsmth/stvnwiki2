Brian X. Chen, technology columnist fat The New York Times, on how to "fight" Big Tech's power:

> “We could change our consumption patterns so that we were not just buying new products from the tech giants. And we could show our support for indie developers who make the apps we love.”

Chen's headline is a misnomer, Big Tech is impervious to the protestations of the lone consumer. Even collective efforts to boycott the platforms that undergird society fade away with having had little perceptible impact on, say, Facebook's revenues or influence on its users.

The consumer veto, once a meaningful feature of early consumerist societies, has been kneecapped by scale. Companies are less dependent upon one country, one market, for financial success. Less dependency equals less responsibility. That veto—the ability to reject available products or services— has given way to the illusion of choice. A choice between Goliath and his myopic brother, the Cyclops. Dislike Facebook? Try Instagram. It's a choice we know to be false.

There is a growing community of people abandoning social media, divesting their attention, refusing to volunteer up data for Google's profit. Even those making an active choice between convenience and conscious consumption are often thwarted, however. Facebook maintains shadow profiles for people without an account but are referenced by current users, for example.

In truth, the only way we are likely to see any disruption of Big Tech's consolidation of influence is through regulatory action. Not that I have must faith in politicians to be nuanced and dextrous enough to deliver a pragmatic way forward. The spectre of fatalism lingers, but state power may be the only remaining check on tech companies that have become, now more than ever, pillars of civilisation.

All of that said, Chen gets much correct in his piece, namely the ancillary benefits of being a more conscientious consumer. That is, in the delight offered by avoiding the attention merchants and their appholes in favour of the artisans of our digital milieu: indie developers.

If our data is merely the collateral impact of our online activity, valuable only in the aggregate, it is possible to divert such data to smaller proprietors. By directly funding upstarts and niche communities of interest, Big Tech's power doesn't diminish but at a minimum the flourishing of competitors can be enabled.

I'll close with one more quote from the column:

> “If you can pay for software that you like,” said Brianna Wu, a game developer, “you probably have an ethical responsibility to do so in the same way that you’d have the ethical responsibility to tip a waitress. The reality is that most of the time when you play an indie video game, that group of people have bet their entire company’s future on you paying for it.”
