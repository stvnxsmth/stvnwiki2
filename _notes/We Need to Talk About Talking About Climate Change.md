## Introduction
At Davos this past week, Greta Thunberg addressed the zeitgeist shifting impact of her grassroots climate movement. Far from content, she noted the need for ever greater awareness to be generated. Global attention spiked with the onset of the Australian bushfire crisis and the level of support — financial, logistical, and emotional — could prove a watershed moment in the climate debate. Such devastation is unlikely to be few and far between in the future.

Thunberg is absolutely correct that sustaining this level of awareness and engagement is imperative for decarbonisation to occur. Such action cannot be achieved through awareness alone, however. Not only is there a need to understand the complexity at hand — both climatical and political — but, importantly, *how* we communicate ideas to build broad support for reform.

The task is a difficult one. There exists a gap between the true nature and complexity of the world and the narratives people use to comprehend it. With that in mind, what people think is not merely a matter of facts and figures, but of beliefs and values. Unsurprising then that there are passionate voices on every side of any debate whose beliefs are unshakeable. Those are not the voices to engage. Instead there is an unheard—often skeptical—majority that holds the power to sway discourse, elections, and policy. It is those people who may be persuaded not with partisan politics, but effective precautionary logic.

## Why Facts Don’t Change Tribal Minds
Thunberg’s name elicits a range of often overly extreme opinions — extremities she excels at presenting herself. Of course, the prognostications she regularly makes are not her own, she is a very capable and intelligent parrot of climate science and predictive modelling. Recently she [noted](https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jan/21/davos-2020-donald-trump-greta-thunberg-climate-mark-carney-wef-day-one-live?page=with:block-5e26c51b8f08e97ed2127436#liveblog-navigation) that:

> “…science isn’t at the centre of the conversation, and it needs to be… I’ve been repeating these numbers at nearly every speech I’ve given for the last 18 months.”

Whilst she is right that the science is beyond alarming, the need for political and social consensus is essential to achieve the necessary reforms. The reality is that, alongside a mountainous rise in awareness, a political schism has formed along ideological lines that threatens progress. In light of this schism, climate science may not be persuasive as Thunberg presumes. Partially due to the effects of a few inaccurate predictions granting fodder for skeptics, but predominantly because facts may not change our tribal minds.

Anyone who has spent time on Twitter or in Facebook’s comments instinctively knows what this means. For every fact one person throws up, another four alternative facts are dunked on them in return. Whose facts are **real** facts? Who is *right*? In Psychology, [research shows](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds) that everyone is right, in their opinion. Human beings are well adept at spotting weaknesses in other arguments, but are often blind to their own. Most damningly, this doesn’t improve with education; in fact, higher education levels can actually increase this stubbornness *“…as more knowledgeable people have more informational ammunition to counter argue any stories they don’t like.”* [according to the research](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/opinion/democrats-partisanship-identity-politics.html) of political scientist, Lilliana Mason.

None of which means rigorous scientific information doesn’t matter. Only that, In the age of algorithmically curated newsfeeds, there is dearth of commonly shared media and thus easier to seek out other sources that reinforce existing viewpoints and biases. The temptation to belittle or dismiss those we disagree with — on all sides — compounds the disconnect and may serve only to [entrench their opposition](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/02/the-simple-psychological-trick-to-political-persuasion/515181/) .

One way to start understanding any misgivings is by looking at CO2 emissions data. Western nations have historically emitted more greenhouse gases, but *today*  [China’s emissions account for](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions#cumulative-co2-emissions) *more* than both the U.S. and the E.U. *combined*. Not to downplay the responsibility of the latter, the West has a major role to play; however, activists like Greta Thunberg are remiss in their failure to confront China or, indeed, India with equal fervour. As the historian Niall Ferguson [notes](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/22/cnbc-excerpts-cnbcs-squawk-box-and-cnbcs-sara-eisen-broadcast-live-from-the-world-economic-forum-in-davos-switzerland-today-wednesday-january-22.html), 60% of global emissions released since Thunberg was born in 2003 came from China and 18% from India.

Could the introspective obscurantism of climate activism be contributing to the opposition of right-leaning people? It remains to be seen. However, the uncomfortable truth is that being persuasive is more important than being right. Ideological dogma is nothing without power; and power must be earned at the voting booth. Climate skeptics, whatever the prevailing opinion, are equal citizens with equal access to that booth and ignoring a portion of any electorate is not a winning strategy—politically or for the climate.

## The unknown is known to motivate
That climate models may be unpersuasive and counter productive need not preclude us from taking action. In fact, uncertainty about the effects of climate change (or its causes) actually emboldens the necessity of taking precautionary measures whilst handily steering clear of tribal arguments. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, famed statistician and probabilist, presents  [this argument](https://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/climateletter.pdf) as such:

> “Without any precise models, we can still reason that polluting or altering our environment significantly could put us in uncharted territory… It is at the core of both scientific decision making and ancestral wisdom to take seriously absence of evidence when the consequences of an action can be large…. Ergo, we should build down CO2 emissions, even regardless of what climate-models tell us.

Libertarian economist, Tyler Cowen, [concurs](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/05/my_views_on_glo.html):

> “I do not much trust climate models… Nonetheless uncertainty about final effects gives us more to worry about, not less.” Uncertainty of final effects is laden with *unknown* consequences and often that is more motivating than *known* approximations of harm. It is harder to hedge against the unexpected and thus people are more vulnerable to disaster and subsequent loss. Risks to health and property are remarkably influential over human behaviour and there are other contingent effects of fossil fuel burden that give extra weight to this argument.

Air pollution is a known consequence of our carbon dependence, but what isn’t fully known is the effect this can have on children’s brain development. [Research has shown](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935119302944) that prenatal exposure to pollution may hinder neurodevelopment and lower childhood IQ.

In one paper that showed significant cognitive decline in people exposed to toxic air in China, one researcher [remarked](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/27/air-pollution-causes-huge-reduction-in-intelligence-study-reveals) that “…polluted air can cause everyone to reduce their level of education by one year”. Stats, figures, and science mightn’t be persuasive — the irony here is not lost — but where adults may be more willing to risk their own health, many of those with children may rightly feel the risks are too close to home.

Regardless of persuasiveness, the final point here is that the burden of proof thus falls upon skeptics to show there is no harm in maintaining the status quo. To show that there is **certainty** of final effects and no attendant risks to wider society and indeed the **only** planet we have.
