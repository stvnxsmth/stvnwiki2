Over the years I've made several attempts at blogging. All have failed. The reasons are myriad and common: but imposter syndrome, inconsistency, and a lack of readership. 

Why is this any different? Well, this is not a blog, but an attempt at escaping the strictures of reverse-chronological posting, page views and analytics. This exists primarily for myself, but is shared with the ethos of <i>thinking in public</i>.

Posts are non-linear and constantly evolving. There is no overarching structure or index, instead entries can be found by clicking through the wiki-links like this [[Notes from the Panopticon]].
