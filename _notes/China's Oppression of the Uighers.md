If I were to ask what the biggest story on the planet right now is how would you respond? Trump’s impeachment? Brexit? Cybertruck?

The answer is necessarily subjective but it ought not be. China’s systematic oppression of the Uyghur Muslim minority should be on everybody’s lips.

This is a summary of my reading from the past week with a bunch of links to get up to speed.

# What’s Happening in Xinjiang?

Two [unprecedented](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html) [leaks](https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm/) out of [[🇨🇳 China]] in the past week have pulled back the curtain on the country’s use of surveillance technology and detention centres to suppress its Uyghur muslim minority. This follows  [detailed satellite imagery](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/11/03/china-every-day-is-kristallnacht/?arc404=true)  reported earlier in November showing the destruction sown by the regime s it pursues what can only be called a policy of ethnic cleansing. This includes:

Systematic detention of over a million people.

Establishment of a so-called “re-education” program that forces detainees to relinquish elements of their belief.

15,000 mosques and other religious sites erased and replaced with car parks.

Reports of forced sterilisations and sexual abuse.

## Why?

Ostensibly China is combatting Islamic terrorism after a spate of abhorrent mass stabbings and suicide bombings in 2014 killed hundreds and wounded many more. This issue is of course very real and poignant to many across Europe, the Middle East, and North America; however, China’s approach has diverged significantly from the de-radicalisation policies elsewhere.

President Xi’s top security advisor has referenced similar Islamic terror attacks in the U.K. and Europe in claiming that human rights protections hinder the ability of governments to respond.

Terrorism is unpredictable by nature and nations across the globe have struggled with all varieties of such violence. But this cannot justify *indiscriminate*detention of any group.

In reality, the persecution of the Uighurs is the culmination of a decades long drive for a totalising surveillance apparatus designed to prevent public revolt and to entrench the regime’s reach and power.

## Has China responded to the leaks?

Yes. China has claimed the documents are “fake news” in the most unoriginal rebuttal since, well, you know who. Furthermore, a government spokesman went as far as flat out  [denying the existence](https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm/)  of “detention camps” in Xinjiang province:

“First, there are no so-called “detention camps in Xinjiang… the trainees could go home regularly and ask for leave to take care of their children.”

### Scratch beneath the surface a little…

A document manual meant for the children of detainees  [leaked by the New York Times last week](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html)  claims they are “*students*”, not criminals, but can not leave “*school*” directly contradicting the statement.

China is clearly fearful of a backlash to their practices with the regime stipulating that the length of detention is directly correlated with the behaviour of prisoner’s family.

[Footage obtained by the ABC](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-23/video-uyghurs-shaved-blindfolded-xinjiang-train-station-china/11537628)  and taken at a train station shows a group of Uighurs blindfolded, heads shaven, and bound.

## Who authorised the construction of the camps?

As ever with authoritarian regimes the paper trail is deliberately obfuscated in order to diminish responsibility and grant plausible deniability for any atrocities committed down the chain of command.

President Xi himself in private speeches from 2014 called for “*…a period of painful, interventionary treatment.*” for extremism. Meanwhile, today China maintains the camps are “*job training centres*” that include “mild methods” for combatting terrorism. The evidence shows the mixed messages to be deliberate.

Xi may not have ordered internments or any specific measure taken, BUT his speeches calling for “*absolutely no mercy*” in the efforts to quell terrorism were distributed internally as justification for the camps.

Chen Quanguo, a party boss for the Xinjiang region, disseminated the speeches and dictated an order to “*round up everyone who should be rounded up…*” whilst purging officials suspected of resisting.

# China: Surveillance State

China’s pursuit of a comprehensive [[surveillance]] apparatus has long been known; however, its uses and effectiveness are only now being fully realised.

Much has been made of the  [social credit system being built](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-new-tool-for-social-control-a-credit-rating-for-everything-1480351590)  out across China and is rightly condemned for its dystopian methods.

The system is connected to a  [centralised database](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2115094/china-build-giant-facial-recognition-database-identify-any)  used to identify and track citizens.

The database includes “*everything from an individual’s exact height and electricity use, to the colour of their car, whether they socialise with neighbours and even if they prefer to use the front or back door to their house.*”  [according to The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/china-cables-revealed-power-and-reach-of-chinas-surveillance-dragnet) .

Want to buy a smartphone in China? That  [requires a face scan](https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/11/ai-weekly-in-china-you-can-no-longer-buy-a-smartphone-without-a-face-scan/)  to be taken and likely used to build out the database.

Even foreign nationals entering Xinjiang province are  [required to install malware](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7xgame/at-chinese-border-tourists-forced-to-install-a-text-stealing-piece-of-malware)  that steals their text messages and other files.

The technology used to deploy and grow such an extensive surveillance program is also for sale and thus the issue is not confined to China. As  [democracy continues to decline](https://www.cfr.org/news-releases/global-report-decline-democracy)  around the world, hardline governments will seek out draconian ways to maintain their power.

Such technologies are only growing more powerful, too. “ [Predictive policing](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/china-cables-revealed-power-and-reach-of-chinas-surveillance-dragnet) ” systems are in use to detect and predict crimes before they occur based upon behavioural data.

Predictably, “*…they are pre-emptively going after people using that data, before they’ve even had a chance to actually commit the crime.*” which in turn is used as justification for rounding up Uyghurs by the thousand.

### But What About…

Yes, yes. This is all relative, right?

The [Edward Snowden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/sep/13/edward-snowden-interview-whistleblowing-russia-ai-permanent-record)  revelations alone show that we cannot be self-righteous when we have been blind to abuses in our own system for decades.

Even the malignant social credit database has a shadowy and underreported upon counterpart in the U.S. that, as  [detailed by the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/business/secret-consumer-score-access.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share) , tracks consumer behaviour and packages the data for sale to whomever wants it, way beyond the function of credit worthiness.

In fact, western democracies have proven so effective at suppression and surveillance that there’s an  [uncomfortable connection](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/30/how-american-racism-influenced-hitler)  to many authoritarian regimes throughout history.

For example, Adolf Hitler praised American racial segregation and eagerly noted how white settlers there “*gunned down the millions of redskins to a few hundred thousand.*”

Now, Nazi comparisons make me queasy, especially in the present moment in which the use of the label is so cavalier as to render it meaningless. If everybody is a Nazi, then nobody is, and that’s a problem.

However, a critical understanding of history—especially when interrogating the history of one’s own nation and their actions—is necessary to adjudicate the behaviour of nations in the present. A hypocrite cannot be taken seriously.

Therefore, *if* it is fair to cite America’s influence on Hitler, it is also fair to compare China’s camps to those of the Third Reich. I personally do not require a predictive policing system to know that the indiscriminate imprisonment of *one million* of any one demographic is beyond the pale.

Nor do I require evidence of dead bodies such as those seen at Treblinka to feel justified in signal boosting the alarm.

It is the responsibility of all countries to condemn this action and for companies operating out of any democracy to take heed of their priorities. History will not look kindly upon those who cosy up to authoritarians for profit.

When users of TikTok are [raising the alarm and being censored](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/27/tiktok-makeup-tutorial-conceals-call-to-action-on-chinas-treatment-of-uighurs), [Japanese manga](https://togetter.com/li/1398032) depicting the plight of one female detainee gaining 2.5 million views, but corporations remain silent, we show ourselves to be morally moribund.

[China to take over Kenya’s main port over unpaid loan](https://www.africanstand.com/business/china-to-take-over-kenyas-main-port-over-unpaid-huge-chinese-loan/): China’s use of their vast wealth to gain power in regions throughout the world, impinging on the sovereignty of its lenders in the process, should be called out for what it is: neo-colonialism.

Not for the first time, either. See:  [Sri Lanka](https://www.africanstand.com/news/world/asia/just-like-zambia-sri-lanka-also-handed-over-its-port-to-china-to-pay-off-debt/) ,  [Macedonia](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-silkroad-europe-montenegro-insi/chinese-highway-to-nowhere-haunts-montenegro-idUSKBN1K60QX) ,  [Ethiopia](https://qz.com/africa/1634659/ethiopia-kenya-struggle-with-chinese-debt-over-sgr-railways/)  as struggling to maintain repayments on Chinese loans.

When such loans amount to 80% of GDP in some cases it is clear China is acting irresponsibly with dire consequences.
